  subheader: 'TrueBit, in collaboration with artist Jessica Angel, are creating an open source, massive public art installation connected to the blockchain in real time.'
  content:
    - 'This public structure will be the starting point for creative interactions and collaborations to happen with creatives from different parts of the world using the blockchain as a creative tool.'
    - 'We are facing exciting times in the history of humanity, and this project will pay tribute to the greatness of this technology, while proposing a holistic approach to knowledge; where music, art, education, economics, mathematics and philosophy take place under the same roof.'

  subheader: 'This first art project proposes the visualization and experience of immersion inside the “dogetherium bridge”, an endeavour that TrueBit is undertaking to create a “bridge" between the Dogecoin and Ethereum blockchains.'
  content:
    - 'Using high impact, immersive and interactive art, in conjunction with the underlying coding and computational workings happening in the Doge-ETH bridge, this project aims to foster community, participation and reflections around the pioneering work in the blockchain ecosystem.'
    - 'The art installation will be a traveling, penetrable sculpture that will provide an indoor and outdoor experience in the form of sounds, light and design. The surface of the installation will reflect the activity in the Doge-ETH bridge. The sculpture will be the space were creatives will realize their artistic vision.'

  content:
    upper:
      - 'The starting point to conceptualize the public art structure is the Mobius bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Avon, designed by Hakes Associates of Bristol, UK. We found this bridge to be remarkably interesting as it explores the structure of the Mobius strip, providing a connection between point A and B while maintaining a single, unified surface.'
      - 'The Mobius strip leads to the construction of a very interesting solid called the Klein Bottle. Imagine connecting the sides of a paper ring to come up with a donut shape. Similarly, imagine connecting the sides of a Mobius strip, you would end up with a Klein bottle.'
    lower:
      - 'The Klein bottle shares the same characteristics as the Mobius strip of having a unified surface. In addition, the Klein bottle provides an enclosed environment perfect for the development of a public programming schedule to take place inside of it. Hence, The public art structure will be a penetrable Klein bottle that symbolizes the bridge between the Dogecoin and Ethereum blockchains, connecting the outer side with the inner surface through the bottleneck pass way.'
